How can we listen to "http.Server" events? Or how can we instantiate a "http.Server" object?
According to nodejs.org/api.html:
"http.Server" is an EventEmitter with events like "request", "connection" .. etc.
However I can't find a way to listen to these event as I am not sure how to instantiate a "http.Server" object. All examples I can find are using "http.createServer" and the api return a new web server object instead of a EventEmitter object.
So, if I wosuld like to know "connection" event, how should i do so?
